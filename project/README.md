##### We finished Stage 1.
##### We finished Stage 2.
##### We partially finished Stage 3. We created a struct Parser and implemented a function for each EBNF rule. Our Program function is able 
##### to return false or true if the file input is correct or not. However, we did not get a chance to implement custom error.
##### We started on Stage 4 and created an XHTML file inside our Program function and prints out the information of the file input. We also 
##### had another xhtml file that has a navy background and a default orange font.


##### 
##### To run our program, write "cargo run example1.x" and example1.x can be replaced with any example.x files.
